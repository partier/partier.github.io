It was a pretty quick meeting today. Congratulated ourselves and especially Zach for getting our first ever trailer video done. He went the extra mile, staying up til after 5am to get it done the day before the deadline. After that, he took critiques really well and tweaked the sound for us in time to swap it out before the deadline. Check out [all his hard work](http://youtu.be/jtpcS2XM74I)!

We talked about what needs to be done for this week, most notably the PubNub integration. Jeff is still working on getting our testing platform up and running to streamline development in the future, and we still got questions for the Indie guys about what we can and can't do with the Minibooth if we get in. Been a busy week for us, and I'm sure we'll all be glad for a holiday weekend coming up! I know I am!

That's all for this week. We'll catch you in two weeks, when everyone comes back from Thanksgiving holiday, heavier but happier.
