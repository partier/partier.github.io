Hey everyone, welcome to the _Partier_ Development Blog! _Partier_ is a game about social exchange, designed to encourage interaction between guests at events ranging from professional networking conventions to drunken house parties — and everything in between. It's a mobile app for Android, iOS and Windows 8 that periodically sends simple cards to a guest, prompting them with some form of outgoing activity to get people talking and having fun, encouraging them to be active in the party with suggestions like:

> You are a model HI-5 party enhancement robot. Your enhancement subroutines dictate that you identify targets in your proximity and enhance their experience by delivering a high five.

Or:

> How many hats can you wear at once?

Or even:

> You are now a mime. I'm… I'm sorry.

_Partier_ has an interesting paradox in its design; in ideal situations, it isn't played at all. We want it to take a backseat to the connections people make naturally, and we're there to help facilitate that if people want the extra push to get out there and have a good time.

_Partier_ started as an idea between two of our devs, Jeff and Zachary, who developed a paper-prototype during the proof-of-concept stage a few years ago. They threw a small party and tried it out, and everyone had a great time. They had the idea to bring it to mobile, and _Partier_ was born.

The initial mobile version was shortlived, reaching a rough demo then getting pushed aside by a larger project. Later, Jeff and Zachary once again found themselves thinking about social augmentation, and _Partier_ was pulled off the shelf. Rewritten and redesigned, _Partier_ is back and better than ever, as is the team, growing from two to six members. Jeff does all of our server work and handles the business side of things. Zachary is our designer, web presence guru, and pinch-hits as a mobiel developer when the need arises. Brandon is our Android developer; Brent is our iOS dev; and Charlie is our Windows Phone guy. Finally, Ben is our producer, making meetings happen, writing emails, and writing up blog posts remarkably similar to this one! :D

Zachary set up a development blog, so you can follow our progress. We'll try to post something every week, ranging from high-level game design theory to low-level technical triumphs. We think we're creating something awesome, and we hope you do too! Follow us and we'll keep you posted as the whole project unfolds!
