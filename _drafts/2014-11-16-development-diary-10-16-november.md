Hey everyone, welcome to the Partier Development Blog! Partier is a game about social exchange, designed to encourage interaction between guests at events ranging from professional networking conventions to drunken house parties and everything in between. It's a mobile app for Android/iOS/Windows that periodically sends simple cards to a guest, prompting them with some form of outgoing activity to get people talking and having fun, encouraging them to be active in the party with suggestions like:

"You are a model HI-5 party enhancement robot. Your enhancement subroutines dictate that you identify targets in your proximity and enhance their experience by delivering a high five."
or
"How many hats can you wear at once?"
or even
"You are now a mime. I'm ... I'm sorry."

Partier has an interesting paradox in its design; in ideal situations, it isn't played at all. We want it to take a backseat to the connections people make naturally, and we're there to help facilitate that if people want the extra push to get out there and have a good time.

Partier started as an idea between two of our devs, Jeff and Zach, who came up with a card game for its proof-of-concept stage a few years ago. They threw a small party and tried it out, and everyone had a great time. They had the idea to bring it to the mobile phone instead of printing out cards, and Partier was born. It was shortlived at first, having gotten to a rough demo, then pushed aside by a larger project. After that larger project came to a close, Jeff and Zach once again found themselves with free time, and Partier was pulled off the shelf. Rewritten and redesigned, Partier is back and in full swing with a team of six now. Jeff does all of our server work as well as the business side of things. Zach is our designer, web prescence guy, and helps out on the mobile clients when needed. Brandon is our Android developer; Brent is our iOS dev; and Charlie is our Windows Phone guy. Lastly, Ben is our producer, making meetings happen, writing emails, and writing up blog posts. Like this one! :D

Zach got this blog set up so we can you guys informed about how our progress is coming and what we're up to! We'll try to post something every week and get our devs to write in more technical blurbs about Partier every now and then. We think we have a unique game here, and we hope you do too! Follow us and we'll keep you posted as the whole project unfolds!
