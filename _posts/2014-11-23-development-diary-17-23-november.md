This week went great! We've been working on our application to the Indie Megabooth at PAX East, the biggest hold-up being we don't have a video of our app in use. Well, I should say we "didn't" because Tuesday last week the six of us got together with a couple friends as extras, threw a goofball party, and shot our first ever video of Partier. Check it out here!

It took a some work to make 8 people look like a whole party, but we did it! Clever camerawork and editing on Zach's part really sold it for us. Jeff also made up some deviled eggs for the shoot, something we all assumed to be a super lame party food ... until Brandon showed up and wanted nothing more than to eat half a dozen or more of our prop! We had to fight him for at least half an hour over why he couldn't have even just one. We came to a compromise that he can get the first one if he could just wait a few more minutes - a compromise that almost ended in war when our friend Duke arrived to be an extra and didn't hear the rules, eating an egg right in front of Brandon and not knowing why he was getting the death glare.

Zach really put in the extra mile for us on this too, staying up til well after 5am that morning to get the first round of editing done. With the deadline for submission on the 20th, we gave us plenty of time to check it out with plenty of time to spare and offer some suggestions. He got those done for us too, and we submitted it maybe 6 hours before the deadline. Thanks again, Zach! You're a beast!

As for our sunday meeting, we talked a lot about what Partier is still lacking, most notably the PubNub integration. Jeff is still working on getting our testing platform, Travis, integrated to streamline development in the future, and we've still got questions for the Indie guys about what we can and can't do with the Minibooth if we get in. Been a busy week for us, and I'm sure we'll all be glad for a holiday weekend coming up! I know I am!

That's all for this week. We'll catch you in two weeks, when everyone comes back from Thanksgiving holiday, heavier but happier.
