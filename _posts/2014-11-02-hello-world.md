Welcome to the _Partier_ development blog! The team is hard at work on _Partier_, a social game designed to inject a bit of controlled chaos into any social gathering, but I wanted to take a moment to say, "Hi."

The _Partier_ team is a small group of professional game developers, including artists, programmers and UI/UX gurus, and we'll be using this blog to pull back the curtains to give you a behind-the-scenes look at social game development. I encourage you to follow this blog to share in our successes and learn from our failures as we continue development and attempt to launch our first social game on Android, iOS and Windows 8!
