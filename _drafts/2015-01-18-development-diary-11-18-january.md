Hey everyone, we're back from the holidays. It's been a bit longer than we'd all hoped, but I think everyone welcomed the break. Another update on the Brandon-front, he has officially moved down south and just in time to miss the wonderful cold and misery of an Alabama winter; his wife will be joining him this weekend. He's coming back up in the middle of this week andwe're all helping them move out on Friday. Good times will be had by all, for sure.

As for progress on Partier the last couple weeks, mostly folks have been taking it easy with family over the holidays. But we managed to find time here and there to put stuff together. Jeff has account creation code working in an isolated test, but we need to move it to prime time on Heroku, unfortunately not an easy task. The return of Gatsby and account info are all tied together and requires a bit of work to get all implemented at once. Zach has been at work getting these blog posts up for all you fine folks out there to read.

Mid-week edit: we just heard back from PAX East, and we did not get accepted to the Indie Megabooth :( But our spirits aren't dampened, and we think it's more of a relief than anything. It would be super rushed to get marketing materials set up in time now, plus we still have considerable work to do. We'll discuss more about it at our next meeting!
